# Letterle
Project worked on at ICPC 2022 (International Collegiate Programming Contest)

Letterle is a spinoff of the popular game Wordle. Instead of picking a 5 letter word, the user can select a combination of any 5 letters.

The user has 7 tries to guess the right combination and the program will output G if the letter is in the right spot, Y if the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, and X if the letter is not in the word.

When using the user input file, the method takes no parameters and the 5 letter Letterle is defined by user input in the console when the code is ran.
When using the parameter file, the method takes a parameter of a 5 letter Letterle.
