# Letterle
Project worked on at ICPC 2022 (International Collegiate Programming Contest). Letterle is a spinoff of the popular game Wordle. Instead of picking a 5 letter word, the user can select a combination of any 5 letters.

When the file is ran, input the 5 letter combination that you want to set as the Letterle. The user has 7 tries to guess the right combination and the program will output G if the letter is in the right spot, Y if the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, and X if the letter is not in the word.
